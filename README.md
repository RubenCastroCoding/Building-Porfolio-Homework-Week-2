<p> This week I was asked to make a portfolio. In this project i created working links to my github respository and also shared a little information about me. In addition to all that, I added some styles like hovering effect, changed colors of blocks of content, added used display flew with some flex wrap. Tried to use semantic elemnets and comments.
