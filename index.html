        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div id="info">
          <p>
            I'm a sales manager for GEE HVAC, I have been with the company for 2 years. I have been responsible for
            training all new and current associates in our company. Being part management is something I really enjoy
            but I also love to work on projects. I always wondered how a website was designed and it has been a goal for
            me to become a software engineer. I saw the apportunity with Georgia Tech and now I'm here working two jobs
            and going to school in order to achieve my goal, wish me luck and please come back to my porfolio when I'm
            done with my bootcamp.
          </p>
